# What is CopydogAI?

CopydogAI is a brand new project. It will allow a user to pull in an
existing website's content and structure. The user can then "clean up" the
content and make it available via an API for other applications to use.

CopydogAI will also allow a user to generate new content based on
the existing content and structure. This will allow the user to create a new
website that is similar to the existing website, but with different content,
while maintaining other aspects of the existing website, such as the general
page structure and SEO characteristics.

## Why?

Migrating a website from one platform to another is a pain. Often, a website
will have a lot of content this is no longer relevant, such as framework-specific
markup. Most users don't have the time or resources to manually clean up the
content, so they end up leaving it as is, which can hurt their SEO. Or they
end up paying a lot of money to have someone else do it for them.

CopydogAI aims to make this process easier and more affordable.

## Project Status

CopydogAI is currently in the initial stages of development. I'm working on
building out the core functionality and getting the basic API up and running.
